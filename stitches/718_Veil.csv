718,Veil,Multiple of 1 stitch,,https://www.knittingfool.com/StitchIndex/StitchDetail.aspx?StitchID=718,1,R,"Insert needle into the stitch as if to knit, then bring the yarn from under the right-hand needle forward between the crossed needle tips (to a purl position beneath the left-hand needle); then up in front of, and over the top of the left-hand needle; then to the back over the top of the right-hand needle, then down in back and under the right-hand needle.  Then knit the stitch, bringing out the last strand that was passed under the right-hand needle, and passing the point of the right-hand needle, as it is removed from the stitch, beneath and clear of the crossed strands still on the left-hand needle.  As the stitch is completed, these strands are dropped off the left-hand needle to form the twisted base of the stitch."
